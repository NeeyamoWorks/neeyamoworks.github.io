# About Us
 
 **Experience the power of tech-enabled global payroll & EOR solutions**




## NeeyamoWorks

As a technology-first company, Neeyamo was always concerned with optimizing employee experience while minimizing employee intervention. With the understanding that accuracy increases multifold with fewer human fingers on things, NeeyamoWorks was born. The technology arm and the heartbeat of Neeyamoâ€™s solution suite was conceived to provide bleeding-edge technology with multi-lingual support.

# Global Expansion

With a rapidly expanding client base increasingly based in a multitude of locations, Neeyamo decided to take a unique approach to global expansion. Our twin-prong approach consisted of a global delivery center (GDC) and a proximity delivery center (PDC) to address customer needs. Since then, Neeyamo has opened its doors to employees with offices in 30+ cities across six continents.
